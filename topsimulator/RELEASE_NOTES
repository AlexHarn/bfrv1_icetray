Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----

V01-03-02
---------

* link cleanup and documentation updates

V01-03-01
---------

* (r158928)  Added support for printing most types
* (r156953)  Adapted to latest dataio changes.
* (r158807)  Updated test scripts

V01-03-00
---------

* Added tank geometry to interface injector service base class.
* Added CorrectObservationLevel parameter to I3CorsikaThinnedInjector that
  causes and automatic check of the observation level in corsika showers.
* Added GetObsLevel to I3CorsikaReader.
* Added GetSnowHeight method to I3TankResponse interface.
* New particle injector for thinned CORSIKA files: I3CorsikaThinnedInjector.
  It should be used with care as it has not been validated.
* Removed an older segment called SimulateOld.

V01-01-02
---------

* Added an ExtendedI3Particle class that includes a data member for the air
  shower component it belongs to.
* Particle injectors now set the particle's air shower component. This is
  propagated all the way until DOM simulation, creating lists of I3MCPEs, where
  it becomes impossible to proceed due to droop. The definition of components
  is up to the injectors.
* Added I3TopAddComponentWaveforms, a module to add "waveforms" corresponding
  to the classification of air shower particles in components. These waveforms
  are made from the I3MCPEs within the time window of each launch.
* renamed sim-icetop.py -> sim_icetop.py and sim-single-particles.py -> sim_single_particles.py
* Add the option to adjust the observation level in I3CorsikaInjector.
  This is to avoid injecting particles under the top of the snow.

V01-01-00
---------

* Added importance sampling algorithm to be used for low-energy showers.
  To use the algorithm, set the ImportanceSampling parameter in I3CorsikaInjector.
* Added sim-icetop.py and sim-single-particles.py to resources/scripts.
  These can be used for general simulations.
