Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----------------------------
- Bugfix: ChangeSnowHeight_interpolated not behaving correctly for a) stations near where 
there is a "hole" ('-') in the in-situ measurement spreadsheet, or b) days that exactly match
the day of an in-situ measurement.  Routine reformulated to be more graceful.

- Unit test added for ChangeSnowHeight_interpolated, and CMakeLists modified to include resources/test

- python3 compatibility tweaks
