These things are a refactoring of dcorsika.py in simprod-scripts in order to make it more readable and more flexible. It adds a builder, so in principle one can build on the fly, but clearly this builder is rather simple.

There have been some changes in parameter names:
-------------------------------------------
  Old name               New name
-------------------------------------------
  model                  he_model
  lemodel                le_model
  cthmin/max             theta-min/max
  cphmin/max             phi-min/max
  donkg                  no-nkg             We can change this back (what should be the default?
  doegs                  no-egs             We can change this back (what should be the default?
  runnum                 runnr              (the "new" name is the corsika name)
  firstevent             evtnr              (the "new" name is the corsika name)
  nevents                nshow              (the "new" name is the corsika name)
  crtype                 prmpar             (the "new" name is the corsika name)
  --flat_detector        --geometry=flat    This is to be consistent with other compile options
  logfile                log
  URL                    url
-------------------------------------------

Some parameters that are not in the new version. Notably some directories, and there is corsika_path instead. The removed options to deprecated_options if there is a way to fix the logic, or they can be added again. Removed options:
  topdir
  tmpdir
  cachedir
  cvmfs
  skipoptions
  ecuts
  ratmo
  pipe (this has actually never been included)


Some hardcoded parameters changed. This still needs looking into.
  save_long
  ecuts#
  arrang
