-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

Release V01-11-00
-----------------
* Added support for re(over) sampling of corsika showers in photon propagation stage.
* Support for individual SPE templates.

Release V01-10-04
-----------------
* Support (including traysegments) for unbuased muongun generation
* Updated defaults for NuGen
* Updated default ice model
* Bug fix: skip I3MuonSliceRemoverAndPulseRelabeler if MMCTrackList is None

Release V01-10-02
-----------------
* added option to control NuGen's zenith sampling mode

Release V01-10-01
-----------------
* Config parameters for NuGen differential x-sections
* Enable histograms for MuonGun

Release V01-10-00
-----------------
* Support for new modes in neutrino-generator
* Added jcorska (corsika_dev)

Release V01-09-00
-----------------

* Added S-,M-frames to MuonGun IPModule. S-Frames are needed to weigh MuonGun events.
* Added I3PrimaryPulseMapper from sim-services to generate an I3ParticleIDMap that associates MCPulses with
  the primary of the particle that produced them. PMTResponseSimulator adds an I3ParticleIDMap that maps pulses with
  the particle that produced them but often these secondary particles are not saved in order to save space on disc.
* Added a merged I3MCTree that combines SignalMCTree and BackgroundMCTree in order to keep output compatible with 
  previous versions.
* Fixed a problem with GENIE NuTau + GEANT4 not working due to the I3TauSanitizer. Also
  added the ability to shift the center of the GENIE generation volume.
* Switched GENIE from using the 2.6.4 splines to 2.8.6 splines
* Added documentation and tests.

Release V01-08-07
-----------------

* IP2 needs the corsika version to be a string

Release V01-08-06
-----------------

* Corrects a bug in ppc module that inavertently renamed mcpes.

Release V01-08-05
-----------------
* Corrects a bug in ppc module that inavertently renamed mcpes.

* Added option to disable Histograms
* Added option to set CORSIKA run number.
* Renamed diplopia instances to polyplopia
* Added SelectNeutrino option in Corsika for CORSIKA-neutrinos
* Added sanity checker for PPC
* Turned Corsika into a ParsingModule.  The bool parameters are now proper 
  toggle switches and don't take a specific value anymore. (r144343 and r144345)
* Removed double deletion of frame object in the ppc segment, which would have thrown. (r138265)
* Removed the IceTop segment.
* Removed RepairBrokenGCD segment.  There are checks for pathological 
  voltages in the GCD validation scripts, so this correction isn't 
  needed anymore.
* In python/modules/corsika.py, changes in Corsika5ComponentGenerator, add default GCD
  create ouputdir for xml and i3 files.
* Create documentation in resources/docs/modules/corsika.rst


Release V01-08-04
-----------------

* Added option to set CORSIKA run number.
* Renamed diplopia instances to polyplopia
* Added SelectNeutrino option in Corsika for CORSIKA-neutrinos
* Added sanity checker for PPC

Release V01-08-03
-----------------
* Fixes problem with very long paths on INPUT corsika cards

Release V01-08-02
-----------------

* Only add the _withoutNoise variable when we use noise (#1702)

Release V01-08-01
-----------------

* Fixed several bugs int the nugen coincident simulation chain
* Remove runid from generators. Now assigned at detector level.

Release V01-08-00
-----------------

* Turned Corsika into a ParsingModule.  The bool parameters are now proper 
  toggle switches and don't take a specific value anymore. (r144343 and r144345)
* Removed double deletion of frame object in the ppc segment, which would have thrown. (r138265)
* Removed the IceTop segment.
* Removed RepairBrokenGCD segment.  There are checks for pathological 
  voltages in the GCD validation scripts, so this correction isn't 
  needed anymore.
* In python/modules/corsika.py, changes in Corsika5ComponentGenerator, add default GCD
  create ouputdir for xml and i3 files.
* Create documentation in resources/docs/modules/corsika.rst

Release V01-07-13
-----------------

* Add option to enable GPUs in CLSimPlusGenie

Release V01-07-12
-----------------

* Fix for ParamsMap in GenerateNeutrinos

Release V01-07-11
-----------------

* Moved efficiency down-sampling after polyplopia 
* Added SkipKeys option to IC86 module 

Release V01-07-10
-----------------

* no-hole-ice option for hybrid mode
* Allow detector segments to be more easily run by humans
* Remove DOMSimulator options, since we can't run it anymore
* Remove old references to /net/user
* Detector option for time shift skip keys (to not time shift specified keys)
* Default to I3LinearizedMCTree 
* Default DOM efficiency to 0.99
* Better handling of renamed I3MCPESeriesMap
