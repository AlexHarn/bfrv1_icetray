Physics Overview
================

Introduction
------------

The light yield and hit time information for cascade-like events is based on
the Photonics tables for electro-magnetic showers. The tables contain
normalized information (time and amplitude) for a point like light source
with a fixed angular emittance pattern.


Logitudinal Development
-----------------------

Without any special treatment, cascade-like particles do not have any spatial
expansion in the simulation. In order to take into account that the light
emittance volume is a couple of meters in length for cascades above TeV energy
one can split a single cascade into parts. Each of these sub-cascades gets a
fractional energy according to the energy loss profile and is displaced in
space and time according to the direction of the original cascade.

Using a detector simulation like GEANT one can obtain a parametrization for
the energy loss profile (`see Ch. Wiebusch thesis chapter 5 <https://web.physik.rwth-aachen.de/~wiebusch/Publications/Various/phd.pdf>`_),
including all energy loss processes. At high energies, well above the critical
energy Bremsstrahlung and Pair production processes govern the longitudinal
development of electro-magnetic showers. At energies above 1PeV the cross
sections of these processes are suppressed and high energy secondary particles
can travel long distances in the medium before their energy is deposited.
This leads showers with an extension of up to hundreds of meters and the
energy loss profile can't be described by a parametrization due to fluctuations
caused by the high energy secondaries.

Parameterization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The energy loss profile of electromagnetic showers with energies below
1PeV is described by a gamma function (PDG Booklet Section EM-cascades):

.. math::

   \frac{dE}{dt} = E_{0}b \frac{(bt)^{a-1}e^{bt}}{\Gamma(a)}

Here :math:`t` is the depth of the cascade in units of radiation length.
The light yield due to Cherenkov-Radiation follows the same distribution.
Christopher Wiebusch determined the parameters :math:`a` and :math:`b`
using GEANT for the Cherenkov light yield.

Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^

For cascades with an energy above 1PeV a simulation of the shower is performed
(inspired by work in `astro-ph/0511617 <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0511617>`_).
The simulation takes into account Bremsstrahlung and pair production
interactions and works only in one dimension. The suppression of the
Bremsstrahlung and pair production cross sections is included and the
formulas used are taken from Spencer Klein's review (`Suppression of Bremsstrahlung and pair production due to environmental factors <https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9802442>`_).
As shown in the plots, the differential cross sections for both interactions
are suppressed and starting at ~1PeV the mean free path rises significantly.

In the simulation, the particles are tracked down to a threshold energy,
which can be of the order of 1TeV. When a particle falls below this limit,
the energy loss profile is calculated according to the parametrization given
above and the individual energy loss profiles are added up to obtain the total
energy loss profile of full shower. The total energy loss profile is a
histogram binned in radiation length.

The following is the program flow the simulation:

1. Determine interaction point:
  - calculate mean free path/radiation length for particle with
    given energy (integrate differential cross section)
  - draw number according to exp(-x/lamdba) distribution, where
    lambda is the mean free path/radiation length

2. Interaction
  - Create Bremsstrahlung photon/electron-positron pair
  - Sample from differential cross section to get fractional energy of secondaries

3. Deposit or Track particle
  - if energy of primary/secondary particles is larger than
    simulation threshold go on with 1. for each particle
  - else deposit particle: calculate energy loss profile for particle
    and add it to the total energy loss profile

Here is some pseudo code::

	particles = [electron]
	while particle = particles.pop():
	   dx = sampleFreePath(particle.energy)
	   y = sampleCrossSection(particle.energy)
	   if particle == ELECTRON:
	     photon = Photon(particle.x + dx, particle.energy * y)
	   if particle == PHOTON:
	     electron1 = Electron(particle.x + dx, particle.energy * y)
	     electron2 = Electron(particle.x + dx, particle.energy - electron1.energy)

	   if (photon|electron1|electron2).energy > threshold:
	      particles.pushback(photon|electron1...)
	   else:
	      energyLossProfile[x+dx] += getEnergyLossProfile(photon|electron1...)

Calculation of differential cross sections and total cross sections
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As mentioned above, formulas for the differential cross sections are take from
Spencer Klein's review. The total cross section is calculated by integrating
the differential cross section. For the Bremsstrahlung cross section one has
to avoid the singularity at small x (fractional photon energy), therefore a
cut off is introduced. The cut off should be well above the critical energy
and still low enough to have Bremsstrahlung radiation every few centimeters.
By default it is 1 GeV. The cross sections are integrated for different
energies in the range needed for the simulation. The resulting total cross
sections are interpolated using B-Splines. This is done in the initialization
phase of the simulation. Interpolation and integration routines are taken
from the `GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_.

Drawing random numbers from Differential cross sections
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The fractional energy of the secondary particles is drawn from the differential
cross section using a `Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolisâ€“Hastings_algorithm>`_.
As a proposal density function the `Beta Distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution>`_
is used, which matches both cross sections pretty well when the right
parameters are used. Since the cross sections vary with energy a low and
high energy proposal distribution is provided. Therewith, random samples
are generated with a high efficiency and the total performance of the
simulation is very good.

Performance
"""""""""""

Depending on the threshold energy, a single shower with energies in the PeV
regime can be simulated in a few milliseconds (Threshold O(1TeV)).
A 10EeV showers is simulated within less than 3 minutes when the threshold
is set to 50 TeV.

Energy Corrections for Hadron Showers
-------------------------------------
It appears that the light yield of a hadron shower is equal to the light yield
of electromagnetic showers when it is scaled by a factor which is energy dependent.
With increasing energy the hadron shower becomes more and more electromagnetic
and thus the scaling factor becomes nearly 1. Since hadron showers fluctate,
the energy scaling is randomized (Gauss-Distribution) around the mean value.
The parametrization shown on the plot is taken from "On the Cherenkov light
emission of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades"
`(Internal Report by Marek Kowalski) <https://internal-apps.icecube.wisc.edu/reports/amanda/data/20020803-track.pdf>`_
and shows a one-sigma error band of the scaling factor for different hadron
shower events. Since the simulation only knows one type of hadron shower,
the proton parameters are used.

Muon Production in Hadron Showers
---------------------------------

For hadronic cascades muons will be produced. This was taken into account by
simulationg such cascades with Corsika and parameterize the produced muons
(`CMC with muons <http://icecube.physik.hu-berlin.de/~panknin/cmc>`_).
For each cascade the number of muons is a Poisson random number with mean
value taken from the parameterization. Then for each muon an energy
was generated. As a first approximation the muons will have the same
origin and the same direction as the original cascade.
