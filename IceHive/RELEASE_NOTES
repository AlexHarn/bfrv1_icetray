Release V00-01-00

First release of the project!

Dec 11th, 2014 mzoll    (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
-------------------------------------------------
* Correct bug: Parameter "Multiplicity" was not retrieved from the user configuration, until now default-parameter[=4] has been used always. (bug found Matthias Vraeghe)

Nov 13th, 2014 mzoll    (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
-------------------------------------------------
* irradicate bug involving a read-over-memory; undefined behaviour on some archs; this never seriously impacted (I hope)
* change interface, so that pairs of numbers are configured from now on; use the python interface to do so (see resources/example.py)

Oct 31rd, 2014 mzoll    (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
-------------------------------------------------
(Scarry changes: at least for some of you, its Halloween, also known as Sanheim in the germanic culture)

* Rewrite of the Hit-class which is the processing object of HiveSplitter/HiveCleaning. 
* This change effects just the outside/exposed I3Module classes
* Make the class <Hit> a even more lightweight object, transproting only essential information and just keeping a reference to what it represents.
* In this clean up the HitSorting library and reduce it to essential functions;
* Make use of the newly introduced I3RecoPulseSeriesMapHitFaciltity, which centrally implements the conversion forth and back from I3RecoPulse to Hits-objects.
* Added low-level documentation about the HiveSplitter algorithm (requested by Paolo)
* Add documentation on the possibility to drive HiveSplitter as a trigger
* I3TriggerHierarchies do now per standard accompany SplitFrames, but are only augmented with a IceHive trigger-key if configured so 
* NOTE: the I3TriggerHierarchy is now always written to the SubFrames as [TrigHierName]+"_clipped", where [.] is the (user) specified option


->Summarizes: Physics have not changed
(This changes still might require the regeneration of the testfile)


Sept 23rd, 2014 mzoll    (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
--------------------------------------------------
last changes before release:

* moved DistanceMap and VicinityMap definitions to IceHiveHelpers
* moved content of `TriggerSplitterHelpers::` to `IceHiveHelpers::`
* More test functionality to IceHiveHelpers, ClipTriggerHierarchy rectified


August 4th, 2014 mzoll   (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
--------------------------------------------------

* Added another cleaning module 'I3HiveCluster' which writes out the clustered Pulses from HiveSplitter as an unsplit PulseSeries to any frame. (Code is a crossbread from I3IceHive and I3HiveCleaning, nothing new there)
* Added the beginnings of .rst documentation to the project.
* changed default values: IceHive::UpdateTriggerHierarchy->false
* A Critical Bug was found which rendered the settings of *Vicinity* useless and configured them as the regular *RingLimits*; you might see some changes when this is corrected now
* IceHive in its core is now more independent from the IC86 Topology, which is now just specified by configuration files in /resources
* More public headers for the people and less private ones
* considerate compressed memory by use of bitmaps and dynamic map objects for the future
* ease the computation load by linear algorithm and no more forth and back conversions on Maps/Masks
* NOTE: observation of slightly decreased IceHive pulse-selection performance with std-parameters after correction of that critical bug
* More pybindings to the people

July 4, 2014 mzoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
---------------------------------------------

* Got complaints about my English spelling; as a consequence i now spell 'Tripple' correctly as 'Triple' and thereby change change the API and the GUI. Happy updating your scripts folks! 
* Changed default settings for HiveCleaning to (70, 70, 70, 70) throughout.
* Brought tests into a compilable version; TODO add a HiveCleaning-test

June 24, 2014 mzoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
----------------------------------------------

* Project *fully* templated now; waiting for full implementation of general MapOMKeyMapMask to unfold full potential.
* Added Option Multiplicity to HiveCleaning: To make harder requirements if neccessary; settings of 1 and 2 should be still save to use; sensible default =1 for backwards-compatibility 
* TODO think about to make here a charge-sensitive mode also

May 01, 2014 <FUTURE> mzoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
------------------------------------------------------

* removed compatibility modes and ModeOption; replacement for runnning with TroiggerSplitter by parameter "UseTriggerSplitter"
* TODO change the interface for the residuals to real windows (c++-side std::pair and python dataclasses.make_pair)

Mar 10, 2014 <Noisy-dog> mzoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
---------------------------------------------------------

* Some more demonstration scripts
* Removed the 'NoSplit'-option to the benefit of objects now always written to the Q-frame; unwanted P-frames can always be ignored/removed post processing
* some more documentation
* Code-streamlined
* more Masks in the frame: The Split-frames will now also contain the noise around the subevent acoording to the configured padding
* changes to the API, whithout altering the functions
* Added some Helper-functions which are actually of much general use
* Updating the TriggerHierarchy will now add a HiveSplitter triggerKey

Dec 20, 2013  mzoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
----------------------------------------------

* Finial branch-out with new name
* Added Cleaning Module I3HiveCleaning
* Project should be working; report bugs to marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se
