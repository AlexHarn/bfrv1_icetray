StringLLH (old)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   This method is outdated! It should only be used if FiniteReco is fed with
   HLC-only pulses, and you don't want to do that. Use at your own risk and
   only if you know what you are doing. Some legacy documentation can be
   found `here <https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/FiniteReco.StringLLH>`_.
