Release Notes
=============

Dec. 20, 2019 Alex Olivas (aolivas@umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

Nov. 12, 2018 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V02-06-00

* Individual SPE template correction factors and RDE


June 20, 2018 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V02-05-01

* Updates to docs
* Fixes:
  (r160002) Fixes the 3.00521 meter offset in the tilt table (along the gradient direction, only needed for SPICE 3 and above)
  (r159391) process only Q frames; properly skips non-flasher events in time-consuming calibrator/wavedeform

August 31, 2017 D. Chirkin
--------------------------
Release V02-05-00

* merged CUDA and OpenCL versions into single OpenCL version of code
* removed multiple define statements (permanently enabling optional code)
* multiple code optimizations, improved method of copying of photon data to the GPU
* fully merged particle/flasher code into single method, flasher parameters now passed in a particle segment
* added Poisson/binomial sampling of generated number of photons (from mean prediction)
* added cable shadow and DOM tilt code and corresponding flasher-fitted files
* removed obsolete scripts and most of the ice directories; one (most recent and comprehensive) ice directory remains
* added documentation that explains run time parameters and data files


March 24, 2017 D. Chirkin
-------------------------
Release V02-04-00

* possible to save photons on the surface of DOMs (when POUT and PDIR are used)
* photoluminescence implementation in the GPU version (when MOPO is used)
* minor code tweaks to keep up with new compilers
* llh/DirectFit code is updated with cable shadow and DOM tilt


October 21, 2016 A. Olivas
--------------------------
Release V02-03-00

* Improvements to DirectFit?/llh code, mainly in simultaneous unfolding+time search
* Added capability to simulate isotropic flasher source. Set FWID=-1 to enable in flasher simulation
* Added CLSimStep functionality to OpenCL ppc version
* Added time binning (0.1 ns) of photons to limit memory use with HE events.
* Small fix to avoid production of long tracks if MMCtrack has Ei and Ef ==0,
  solves the problem with low energy numu CC interactions
* Modified for optional use with SpiceHD (no angular acceptance but a cut on the DOM impact point)
* Added explicit list of hadrons, so all hadrons will produce light.
* Added interface to CLSim/Geant4 steps to the CUDA version


November 24, 2014 D. Chirkin
----------------------------

Several compilation (warnings) and run time (seg. faults) fixes. New env.
variables OGPU/OCPU/OACC allow running on only GPU/CPU/Accelerator cards.
Includes the final version of SPICE3.

June 30, 2014 D. Chirkin
------------------------

Updated particle tree parsing to work with corsika when pi/K's are saved.
Changed the build preference: prefer OpenCL over CUDA.
Included new ice model: SPICE 3.

March 06, 2013 Marcel Zoll  (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
-----------------------------------------------------

BadDomList is now read from the DetectorStatus for every dom that has HV==0

Tue Jun 26 13:34:57 CDT 2012 Dima Chirkin
-----------------------------------------

Updated bare muon photon yield (new fit from Christopher).
Added SPICE Lea ice model and support.
Also added aha-fixed, wham.
The run.py now works with latest simulation.
Added width parameter for flasher simulation.

October 10, 2011 Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------------

Going to get serious about release notes for individual projects.
