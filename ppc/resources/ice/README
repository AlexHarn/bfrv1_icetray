for use with ppc only

This directory is provided as an example of a valid ice model configuration.
The ice model will occasionally be updated to newer versions, so should not
be used where specific version is needed. Please use ice models contained
within the ice-models module instead.

Files geo-f2k, eff-f2k, and hvs-f2k will overwrite icetray GCD values used
by ppc. To use the GCD values remove one or more of these files.
