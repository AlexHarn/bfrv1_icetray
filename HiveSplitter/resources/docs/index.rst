HiveSplitter
============

HiveSplitter is an advanced event splitter algorithm.
***NOTE***: This project is discontinued as it has been superseded by the integrated solution '''IceHive''', which contains the algorithm of HiveSplitter. With the right parameter setting it IceHive should be able to replicate the output HiveSplitter.

This project is maintained by Marcel Zoll <mzoll@icecube.wisc.edu>.
