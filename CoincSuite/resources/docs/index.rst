CoincSuite
==========

The CoincidentSuite (short CoincSuite or CS) is a collection of event recombination and connected tools for the processing of a multiple subevent scenario. It remedies most of the problems left behind by prior use of event splitters.

This project is maintained by Marcel Zoll <mzoll@icecube.wisc.edu>.
