Release Notes
=============

March 14th, 2017  Marcel Zoll (marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-03-03

- bug with possibly no impact: frame indexes have been switched for cluster
  assignments in decisionMaker; tests execute smoothly - probably that part
  of code never has been triggered or is symmetrical
- Massive python3 fixup, should get most tests to pass with python3 
  -- KJ Meagher
- break out FrameRegister from Helper code
  --Marcel Zoll
- use 'linefit' which implements the 'improvedLineFit' now
  -- David Schultz
- use internal serialization library
- Rearrange Code to fully enclose an if/else-statement; ticket #1790
  (August 9, 2016)
  -- Marcel Zoll

May 2, 2016 Alex Olivas
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-03-02

- cleanups towards c++11 compatibility
  -- David Schultz
- fix an I3Position comparison (fixed #1539)
  -- Marcel Zoll


April 18, 2015 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-03-01

- Use log_fatal if module cannot continue running (in this case, if
  nFrac == 0 in PartialCOG, to avoid divide-by-zero later on)

  -- Marcel Zoll


April 8, 2015 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-03-00

- Get rid of the internal implementation of the which_split-function 
  now that it is implemented in phys-services 
- Fixed bug (int devision always yielding zero) in AfterPulse Discard 
  and Tester, which effectively rendered this module useless
- Added a py-module 'DiscardEmptySplits' removing EmptySplits (splits
  which have no pulses present in the desired RecoPulseSeriesMap)
- Quick fix of malicious behaviour in the reclustering routine, it is
  working now but might need some more checks
- Add parameter "RecombineRecoMaps" to DecisionMaker: keys of 
  I3RecoPulseSeriesMap/Masks in the frames found at these keys will also 
  be recombined, which is useful if already some cleanings etc. have 
  been performed on the SplitPulses! 
- Fix (documentation and other) compile warnings, general code cleanup
- Add option "Offset" to "CreateTimeWindow" so that a additional time 
  can be added to the nominal time-window defined by the first and last 
  pulse in the passed RecoPulseSeriesMap/Mask
- Make the createTimeWindow routine more robust, now it will also give
  a meaningful result (-offset, offset) when there are no pulses
- Correct limit comparison in AfterpulseDiscard
- Add more documentation

  -- Marcel Zoll

- Replace make_shared by boost::make_shared to fix name collisions

  -- Christopher Weaver

- Recognize I3_TESTDATA

  -- Alex Olivas

- Corrected the check for zero pulse length in the createTimeWindow 
  routine

  -- Jan Kunnen


December 11, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-02-00

- Remove obsolete cxx-test
- Fix python tests
- Fix bug where Hypoframe got a null object written if the masks to be
  united were derived more than once (if you were affected, subsequent
  modules would have failed, so you would have noticed)
- Making the code faster and more efficient
- Add Refit-option (default=False) to ReducingLikelihoodTester. Refit =
  True reproduces the old behaviour (the fit is redone), Refit = False
  means that just the LLH values for the fit done before are calculated

  -- Marcel Zoll

- Replaced make_shared by boost::make_shared

  -- Don la Dieu


October 9, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-01-00

First release! This release was made specifically for the 2012 muon L3 
processing metaproject. The tests do not pass yet because the testdata
is not available, but it was checked locally that they pass if the test
file is used. As soon as this is solved, the project will be added to 
icerec.



trunk 2014/06/25 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------------
* added script to just split data, for example to create a testcase: /resources/scripts/split_data.py
* Deprecate the FrameSentinel because the functionality can be easier achieved by a python module: tray.Add(lambda f: return f.Has(FlagName))
* Rename EmptyFrameDiscard to LowNChDiscard in order to reflect better the intended use of the Module; which is to discard NoiseClusters
* Removed al
* Change in UI for TrackLikelihoodTester: changed Parameter names:
* Afterpulse and NoiseClusterDiscard have now a options 'Discard' for direct discard of frames
* Adpated to new lilliput.services interface (I prepend from my previous sins)
* removed paranoid checks for object existence in places that they have to exist
* startet implementation work on helper functions to stich together I3TriggerHierarchies with DecisionMaker
* All Discard and DecisionMaker, which in general identify discardable frames, now have the option 'Discard' to do this on the fly; Also written objects of these to the frame have the name of teh Module now (e.g. <I3Bool>(GetName()))
* Broke out namespace CoincSuite from FrameCombiner into /lib/CoincSuiteHelpers.h/cxx
* Cleaned up the code in some places.
* Started with Unit Tests //TODO finish these
* Two Bugs found in I3FakeCalculator: functions TrackClosestPoint (lines where always intersecting) and TrackSurfaceIntersection (norm was calulated wrong); affected are all Testers which used functions which might have had deminished selection power in the past //TODO investigate
* Added ReducingLikelihoodTester, which is what TrackLikelihoodTester actually should have done; It's selectiveness should be much stronger.
* Depricate TrackLikelihoodTester to the benefit of using ReducingLikelihoodTester
* Depricate CausausalConnectedTester to the benefit of cogCausalConnectedTester
* Depricate CylinderPulsesTester to the benefit of TrackSystemTester
* Changed the interface to specify TimeResiduals to pair<double, double> aka dataclasses.make_pair(double, double)

2013/10/03 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
* In AfterpUlseTester and Discard include the specified threshold values in the concideration (< -> <=)
* Added new Tester: TrackSystemTester : TODO Documentation
* API change for AfterpulsesDiscard: The <I3Int> tag in the afterpulse event is now named after the module name instead of stataid "Afterpulses"!
* TODO move functions in I3FakeCalculator into I3Calculator.cxx
* TODO Unit-tests: write the following:

  * Test for every Tester: if it executes and writes a positive result for a special constructed case
  * The TesterModule and FrameRegister base-functions have to be tested


2013/10/03 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
* found a newly inroduced bug (after code-rewrite) in PartialCOG which prohibited the correct summup (a while loop did break immediatly); the accuricy cogCausalConnected was impacted
* modified eventHeaders are now a integral part of the code


2013/09/19 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
Massive Code Refurbishment with new functionallity

* removed redundant code
* provided a nicer interface (API) through TesterModule and function pointers; should also run much faster;
* /python and /resources are tydied up; lost links an loose ties
* OMKeyHash and HitSorting are now the new and nicer libraries from HiveSplitter
* checked for some functions if we can use copies instead of references and vise versa; where it makes sense
* TODO check if FrameRegister can work with maps instead of vectors to make access faster; NOTE It could however it would not be neccessarily nicer
* new Test emerged from AfterpulseDiscard: AfterpulseTest, it does basically the same thing:
* Frameregister has been fitted with some more convenience functions that should soon allow to make the subordinated Frame-vectors private;
* an experimental parameter to HypoFrameCreater that now will limit the time difference between frames so that Hypoframes are not created from everything, but only objects that make sense
* Nosie and AfterpulseDiscard have been fitted with an option to directly discard according frames instead of going through a seperate module; DANGER ReducedCount might have to be readjusted

2013/07/27 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
Serious code rework

* Corrected inherited bug in AfterpulsesDiscard, in the computation of the charged averaged time, which was rather a time/tot_charge
* Corrected bug in MutualCylinderPulsesTester, which was just testing the criteria one-sided way instead of two-sided.

2013/06/20 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
* more documentation
* more parameter correctness


2013/02/20 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
* many more modules;
* DiscardSplits is now doing the right recombinations; reduced count was right all along
* AfterPulsesDIscard added after input from Chris Weaver, very appreciated, thanks



2013/02/20 mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>
------------------------------------------
almost there for a final release:

* even more modular now
* removed old code fragments
* TODO Documentation
* TODO finalize recombinations of frames: -> DiscardSplits.
* TODO complete resources
* TODO find sensible default parameters
* TODO make histogramming and weighting a little bit more flexible and not so hardcoded: -> histogramming.py
* TODO ...
