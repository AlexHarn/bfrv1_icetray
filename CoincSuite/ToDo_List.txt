ToDo-List
====================
project: CoincidentSuite / CoincSuite

author: mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>

maintainer: mzoll <marcel.zoll@fysik.su.se>

This is a list of things which could be possibly done in the future; if you have an idea worthwhile looking into, put it here.


Accessibility
***************
move functions in I3FakeCalculator into I3Calculator.cxx


Afterpulse testers
******************
Write robust unit-test for this module. current one might not be selective enough.

Make AfterpulseTester and AfterpulseDiscard work on individual DOMs and their consideration of being Afterpulses, rather than making averaged timed and charges

Is the qtot fraction really a good quantity/qualifier?


Services
**************

Move away from the implementation of a inheritable TesterModule communicating over frame-object and use rather a ServiceBase, here testers work than as plug-ins to the DecisionMaker.
Thereby the number of called modules in CoincSuite would decrease by a lot, and no time would be lost in the buffering and debuffering of frames in the FrameRegister.
This could also be contracted with the HypoFrame creator and destructor, as well as the ReducedCount-maker modules etc.

meta-python code of this implementation would look like this:
  tray.AddService("PulseContainmentTester", "PCTservice")
  
  tray.AddService("COGCausalConnectTester", "COGCCTservice")
  
  tray.AddModule("DecisionMaker", "DM",
    LikeList = ["PCTservice"],
    VetoList = ["COGCCTservice"])


tweaks for accessibility
************************
"CS_RecombSuccess" is right now a I3MapStringBool, think about changing that to I3MapStringInt and store the Result (UNDECIDED:-1, NO:0, YES:1)
this needs some tweaks in TesterModule and DecisionMaker, but it should be worth it, because then one can possibly get rid of the "Split+RecombAttempt"-object.
