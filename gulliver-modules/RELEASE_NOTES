Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----

- Log fatal if `OutputName` is not configured rather than falling back to the
  module instance name

September 15, 2017 Kevin Meagher (kmeagher@ulb.ac.be)
-----------------------------------------------------
Release V01-10-01

- Fix output name so that Params are also given the correct name in the
  case OutputName is not supplied

March 23, 2017 EKB (blaufuss@umd.edu)
-------------------------------------
Release V01-10-00

- Added OutputName parameter to I3SimpleFitter and I3IterativeFitter so we can
  stop using the module instance name as the name of the fit.
- I3IterativeFitter can now handle Python objects as services except for
  I3RandomService because of the default used GSL pseudo-random generators.
- Docs cleanup
- use icecube::serialization over boost::serialization
- Python 3 happiness


May 3, 2016 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------

Release V01-09-03

- Example scripts were rewritten in modern python syntax.

  -- Jakob van Santen

- Example scripts don't need a X server anymore if executed with default
  options.

  -- Kai Krings

- Test scripts moved to new test directory and got a code cleaning; the
  `iceopt` module and the `fortytwo` test suite moved to
  `gulliver-modules/python`.

  -- Kai Krings

- A Sphinx documentation was added.

  -- Kai Krings

April 3, 2015 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
---------------------------------------------------

Release V01-09-01

- Recognize I3_TESTDATA.
- Replace I3ParticleVectPtr by I3VectorI3ParticlePtr.

  -- Alex Olivas

- Filter hypothesis through a parametrization if one is provided. This makes
  it possible to use I3LogLikelihoodCalculator with non- trivial millipede
  hypotheses.

  -- Jakob van Santen

December 9, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------

Release V01-09-00

- Use I3_TESTDATA when available.
- Remove I3Writer module from the simplefit.py test.

  -- David Boersma

September 30, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------

Release V01-08-02

- Get RST documentation started.
- Reduce log noise level a little.
- Correct 'fortytwo' test script (was referring to f which had not been
  defined, should be frame, and frame was not being pushed).
- Turn off tests which check that result is always the same for now.
- Remove unused modules from import statement in example script.

  -- David Boersma

July 11, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
---------------------------------------------------

Release V01-08-01

- Adding fortytwo module, which checks if processing results are reproducible
  (will raise runtime error if fits deviate too much from reference results).
  Currently gives errors on some SL5 and OS X machines.
- Python 3 compliance updates.
- Remove TrashCan modules and output modules from scripts.
- Remove references to iceopt.py in test scripts.

  -- David Boersma

April 8, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
---------------------------------------------------

Release V01-08-00

- Make I3IterativeFitter store diagnostics from various gulliver services.

  -- Jakob van Santen

- Allow tarballs.

  -- David Boersma

January 13, 2014 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
------------------------------------------------------

Release V01-07-00

- Remove two very old configuration parameters for the iterative fitter module
  that were meant to be temporary, for debugging/diagnostics:
  ReEnableIterationBug and TweakBugFix.
- Add new option to iterative fitter to allow to let the tweaks on the
  iterative seeds be performed by a different seed service than the one that
  provides the input seed (random seeds need vertex time tweaking, input seed
  may already have a good vertex time).

  -- David Boersma

- Replace I3TensorOfInertia by clast in the script.

  -- Jakob van Santen

August 20, 2013 Meike de With (meike.de.with@desy.de)
-----------------------------------------------------

Release V01-06-04

- Make project compatible with Python 3.

  -- Nathan Whitehorn

- Clean up code, update code and comments in the scripts.

  -- David Boersma

February 21, 2013
-----------------

Release V01-06-03

- Removed Reconfigure method.
- Removed dependency on DOMcalibrator and FeatureExtractor.
- Removed dependency on log4cplus.
- Added tracing functionality: store all parameter values (and corresponding
  function values) that were tried by the minimizer during a fit. This trace
  (if enabled) is stored for every event as an I3VectorDouble object in the
  frame. For now this feature is only available in I3SimpleFitter. It can be
  added in I3IterativeFitter as well. (Note that this feature is kind of
  complementary to the tracing functionality in lilliput's
  I3SimpleParametrization, which stores a vector of I3Particles of all tracks
  that were tried by the minimizer.)

September 11, 2012
------------------

Release V01-06-02

- Use GetName() instead of getting a configuration from the context.
- Allow I3SimpleFitter to accept services directly.
- Cleanup dependencies.

January 11, 2012
----------------

Release V01-06-01

- Added GulliView, a module for visualzing likelihood spaces.
- Removed likelihoods and fits which use obsolte Pandel features.
- Added defgcd option.
- Added filename parameter for non-gui users.
- Use new SetGeometry method.

August 9, 2011
--------------

Release V01-06-00

- Changing the default behavior of the iterative fitter. The vertex tweak
  should be performed *both* before and after rotating the seed track for an
  iteration. The tweak *before* is to ensure that the track stays close to the
  COG of the pulses and is not pulled away unnecessarily far. (The tweak
  *after* is both for positional reasons and to give the seed mostly positive
  time residuals.) The tweak before the rotation has always been omitted. With
  the "enabletweakbugfix" option True this is fixed. The default of this option
  was False in order to not change the default behavior. But now we set it to
  true. So if you really want the default behavior back, identical fits like
  before, then you should set this to FALSE. Initial tests by Benjamin
  Hoffmann (master student in Aachen) indicate that the bugfix has no major
  impact. 50-70% are reconstructed identicallly (which is normal, as often the
  initial fit already finds the best track and the iterations do not improve),
  and the rest of the events only result in very small changes.
  See: http://web.physik.rwth-aachen.de/~icecubemgr/?n=PersonalLogs.TweakVergleich
- If the services have extra diagnostics, save them into the frame.
- Adapted to various changes in offline-software.
- Updated tests.

January 6, 2011
---------------

Release V01-05-01

- Update/fix test.

October 29, 2010
----------------

Release V01-05-00

- Remove integral lookup.
- General cleanup.

June 4, 2010
------------

Release V01-04-01

- New way of handling options in test scripts.

August 11, 2009
---------------

Release V01-04-00

- Fixed bug in iterative fitter
- Added option to iterative fitter to re-enable the bug if you really want to
  (this is useful for testing, and for reproducing old fits).
- Added checks on input particle for I3LogLikelihoodCalculator module.
- Maintenance to scripts and docs.

October 27, 2008
----------------

Release V01-03-00

- Only minor updates (use new Pandel in test scripts).
- Release made for std-processing.

August 19, 2008
---------------

Release V01-02-01

- Minor update to CMakeLists.txt.
- Release made for icerec.

June 24, 2008
-------------

Release V01-02-00

- Added example script for cascades.
- The gulliver modules became I3ConditionalModules; the UseIcePick option gets
  obsolete, use IcePickServiceKey instead.

January 3, 2008
---------------

Release V01-01-00

- Added a simple new module I3LogLikelihoodCalculator: calculates (negative)
  logl\_ and rlogl\_ for a given input track, without doing a new fit. Simple
  for now, only for I3Particle, not generic. Later maybe using a seed service.
- Conditional execution: do a fit only if an icepick keeps the event (note:
  reverse Pretzian logic for I3Bool) This is was necessary for the online
  filtering. In V2 conditional execution comes with the framework, so then it's
  no longer necessary to have this feature defined within this module.
- Major cleanup in scripts.
- Option in I3SimpleFitter to store all solutions as single particles, instead
  of as a vector.

November 2, 2007
----------------

Release V01-00-03

- Option in both fitters to do conditional execution (attempt reconstruction
  only if the event is "kept" by an icepick I3Bool).
- Option in I3SimpleFitter to store all solutions (instead of just the best
  one).

September 16, 2007
------------------

Release V01-00-01

- Add gsl to the USES_TOOLS in project-config.mk (for old style offline-mk).
- In the iterative fitter, do the fit using the input seed only if the
  direction of that seed is within the allowed zenith range, otherwise proceed
  directly to the random/pseudorandom iterations.

September 13, 2007
------------------

Release V01-00-00

- Iterative fitter: if the direction of the seed is not within the the allowed
  zenith range, then skip the fit based on the original seed and start
  immediately with the first iteration.
- Lots of code review things: code conventions and documentation.

August 10, 2007
---------------

Release V00-05-02

- Mostly cosmetics & doxy.

June 13, 2007
-------------

Release V00-05-01

- Simplefitter: uses multiple seeds, if available from seed service (before it
  took only the first available seed)
- Iterative: serious bugfix; tested, looks OK now (version in V00-05-00 does
  not work at all!).
- Scripts: remove MCTruthName from flat-ntuple options, to avoid crash
  suspected backward incompatibility issue with test-data (icesim V01-09-02).

April 13, 2007
--------------

Release V00-05-00

- Simple & iterative: I3LogLikelihoodFit interface change.
- Iterative: cos zenith range option.
- Scripts: some cleanup/updates.
- Scripts: get rid of analysis-tree, go for flat-ntuple.

August 29, 2006
---------------

Release V00-02-00

- Added iterative fitter.
- Tests use input files from icesim-V01-09-02 in toolset.
- Separated scripts/macros between resources/scripts and resources/examples.
