Statement of the problem
========================

Machine learning and classification is a very broad topic. The current
implementation of pybdt is restricted to addressing one commen problem
in experimental or observational physics applications: given some
observed event, how do we determine whether the event consisted of a
signal we are searching for, as opposed to some background? In more
general terms, pybdt addresses binary classification of events. In
this user manual, we will restrict our attention to binary
classification.

Classification models are generated by a process referred to as
*training*.  Training requires an ensemble of known signal events and
an ensemble of known background events. These are referred to as the
*signal training sample* and *background training sample*. Each event
consists of values for several variables, plus a weight.
Classification models may then be used to obtain a *score* for each
event. In pybdt, scores range from -1 to +1, where -1 is
very background-like and +1 is very signal-like.
