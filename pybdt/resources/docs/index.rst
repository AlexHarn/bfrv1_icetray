This project provides a Python interface for signal/background
discrimination using Boosted Decision Tree classifiers (BDTs).

This project is maintained by Mike Richman <mike.d.richman@gmail.com>.

Note that the example scripts are rather complete as well as complementary
to this documentation.  Feel free to email me with any questions.
