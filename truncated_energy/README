This is truncated_energy, adapted from the photorec-based loglikelihood reconstruction algorithm, extracted from the lilliput
project and improved with bug-fixes and new features. The relevant example scripts have been moved over as well. 
The two likelihood functions included in the project are I3WaveformLogLikelihood and I3PhotorecLogLikelihood. 
The former uses waveforms while the latter use reco pulses. Also included are the relevant factories for loading the likelihood functions
for use with gulliver. 

Projects needed to use truncated_energy:

- Was moved from lilliput, but one still needs gulliver, gulliver-modules and lilliput to use truncated_energy. 
- Needs the latest release of photonics-service, since this is a photonics-based reconstruction project.
- One needs access to photorec tables, which are reconstruction specific.

The details of the algorithm along with configuration options can be found in the documentation under index.dox.
Example scripts show examples of how to configure the various modules of truncated_energy.
