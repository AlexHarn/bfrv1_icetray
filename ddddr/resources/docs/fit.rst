Fitting the energy loss distribution
------------------------------------

The energy loss distribution of the muon bundle can be fitted with either of two functions provided in the code:

* an exponential function N*exp(b*x)
* a shortened version of the muon bundle energy loss function used in `<http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4668>` using three free fit parameters.

The result of the fit is stored as :ref:`i3meparams` object.
