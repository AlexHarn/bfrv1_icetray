=====

The modules contained in this project offer a way to characterize the energy loss spectrum of a muon or muon bundle. The differential energy loss is estimated from the light yield along a given track under the assumption of exponential light attenuation in bulk ice. The peak and mean/median of the energy loss are determined and can be used to identify stochastic energy losses.
