This is the readme for wimpsim-launcher by Renzi G. (giovanni.renzi@icecube.wisc.edu)

This scripts are thought to run WimpSim on HTCondor and, in particular, are set to simulate WimpSim generated events in IceCube.
So you have to be on the submitter to run them!

In order to run WimpSim with these scripts it's necessary to have WimpSim installed. The functioning with the latter versions of WimpSim (>5) is not guaranteed.

The main scripts is wimpmaster.py, here you can change the settings according to your intentions:

- with the Env-settings you can set up an IceTray environment (actually not necessary to run, you can set it to a null string )

- the I/O-settings define where you want to save log files and output
    
    (with the code as structured, temporary files are already stored in temporary directories)

- the WimpSim-settings indicate where to find WimpSim and the simulation settings

The main script uses functions contained in condor_submit.py to run the driver*.py scripts, respectively launching wimpann, wimpevents-sun and wimpevent-earth.

The code wants to build a DAGMan job, in which wimpevent is run when wimpann is done (wimpevent is a "child" job of wimpann).

It is strongly recommended to read the old_README, even if the software part is not up-to-date.

The 1 file problem noted in the old_README is solved with the new scripts.
