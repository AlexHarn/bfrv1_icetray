trunk

- I found the modification for adding gsiftp option in the last release may not work
  when iceprod is used. The main function in level3_Master.py was reverted, and now 
  the gsiftp option works only when the script runs without iceprod.
- warnings about OutputName option for many fitter has been solved.


June 12, 2018 Kevin Meagher
---------------------------
Release 2018_0

- Make simulations generated for 2013 or later run the level3-filter-muon.
  There was a bug in filterscripts/resources/scripts/SimulationFiltering.py
  SplitUncleanedInIcePulsesTimeRange was not stored after L1 processing and
  then it was not copied to SplitInIcePulsesTimeRange in L2 processing.
  This bug is fixed in latest trunk of filterscripts, however, to process 
  existing simulation data, restore_tw_for_MC option is added to level3_Master.py.
  If -r option is added, it will make a dummy trigger split frame and copy
  SplitInIcePulsesTimeRange to main target frame, only when the main target
  frame does not contain SplitInIcePulsesTimeRange. See MuonL3TraySegment.py.
- Modified level3_WriteOutput module to run simulations that already contains
  I3LinearizedMCTree at level2.
- Add option to use gsiftp
- fix typo in command line options
- use `direct_hits.get_default_definitions()` instad of global variable
- make this iceprod compatable
- Script Cleanup: remove `Finish()` and `TrashCan`
