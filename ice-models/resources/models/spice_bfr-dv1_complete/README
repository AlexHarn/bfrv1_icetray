this uses a parameterized birefringence-only model of ice anisotropy

#for running with ppc must add files as.dat, wv.dat, and rnd.txt.
This directory contains all necessary files for convenience.
     as.dat defines the angular sensitivity model as fitted to flasher data ("dima")
     wv.dat contains cherenkov spectrum of nominal PMT DOMs

Please let me know (dima) if something is missing or not working
