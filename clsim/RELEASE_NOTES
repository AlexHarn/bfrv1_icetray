-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

* Merge multiprocess-server branch. This is a major restructing of clsim.
  - I3CLSimServer accepts steps over a ZMQ socket and distributes them to
    instances of I3CLSimStepToPhotonConverter. Multiple clients can share a
    server, allowing M:N CPU:GPU ratios rather than only 1:N.
  - I3CLSimModule is replaced by I3CLSimClientModule. I3CLSimClientModule only
    emits I3CompressedPhotons, so no pretty photon histories.
  - MaxParallelEvents and MaxEnergyToProcess options are gone; internal queues
    are filled dynamically to create complete propagator kernel invocations.
  - I3CLSimLightSourceToStepConverterGeant4 is factored into
    I3CLSimLightSourceToStepConverterAsync and
    I3CLSimLightSourcePropagatorGeant4. The latter is truly optional, making it
    possible to use clsim without initializing Geant4.
  - I3CLSimLightSourcePropagatorFromI3PropagatorService allows e.g. PROPOSAL
    to be run in a thread in I3CLSimClientModule. This can be used to save
    memory by discarding stochastic losses as soon as their light yield has been
    simulated.
  - Both I3CLSimLightSourcePropagatorGeant4 and 
    I3CLSimLightSourcePropagatorFromI3PropagatorService can optionally record
    the secondaries they produce in an MCTree.
  - I3CompressedPhoton positions are relative to the module they hit, and have
    oversizing removed.
  - Photons are converted directly to (coalesced) I3MCPE in the collector
    thread of I3CLSimClientModule. This can save significant memory for
    high-energy events.
* Merge spe-template branch.
* I3CLSimLightSourcePropagatorGeant4 can be reinitialized, making it possible
  to change the wavelength bias without starting a new process. This is useful
  for implementing a hobo SnowStorm simulaton where systematic parameters change
  every N frames.
* Removed MMCTrackListName option from I3CLSimMakePhotons. PROPOSAL now emits 
  muon track segments directly, and they do not need to be reverse-engineered 
  by I3MuonSlicer.
* Direct, in-kernel cable shadow simulation can be enabled by setting the
  CableOrientation parameter in I3CLSimMakePhotons. This reduces isotropic
  efficiency by ~10%, but in a directionally specific way.

Release V04-02-00

Major bug fixes are marked with "``***``".
Do not use older versions of clsim without these for anything!

* r153861 + r153865: Make thread unpinning to work around stupid cluster
  managers also work on Ubuntu, and make the tabulator raise an error if no
  CPU OpenCL devices are found.
* r153710: I3CLSimMakePhotons can now take a wavelength acceptance directly.
  The user is responsible for getting all the scaling factors right.
* r149069 + r150508: new parameterizations for hadronic and EM showers are used
  (thanks andrii.terliuk) -> now re-factored into CMC (thanks jvs!)
* ``***`` r148636: fixed the hadronic shower parametrization by using the correct
  radiation length (thanks musner!)
* ``***`` r149250: clsim/Geant4 does no longer use seawater when simulating glacial
  ice. This mostly affects late pulses from neutrons. (thanks asteuer!)
* r149878: hole ice parameterizations can now be configured when setting
  up clsim (thanks sebastian.sanchez)
* several minor improvements to support mDOMs better (such as optional
  oversizing [r148281])
* ``***`` r147029 and r150787: Make clsim run efficiently on GTX 1080* cards and
  on TITAN X GPUs. Do *NOT* use older versions of clsim on these cards
  or you will waste a ton of GPU cycles.
* r143614: Moved I3Photon and I3CompressedPhoton to simclasses
* ``***`` r140057: Fixed a bug where in rare cases the last few frames would not be processed
  by clsim. (Thanks dschultz!)
* r131448: The cutoff distance for sources further away from any DOM than a certain
  distance is now configurable using the I3CLSimModule option
  "ClosestDOMDistanceCutoff". It used to be hard-coded to 300m.
* r130869: New "TotalEnergyToProcess" option to keep collecting input events as long
  as the total energy to be propagated is below a threshold. (Instead of
  just processing a fixed number of events in parallel.) Using this option
  should reduce fluctuations in the memory requirements of clsim jobs.
  This cannot currently be used with flasher simulations. If unset, the
  previous behavior is used.
* various tablemaker fixes

December 22, 2014 Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------------------

Release V04-00-05

* Loading safeprimes files (without the .txt extension).

November 24, 2014 Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------------------

Release V04-00-04

* Builds without OpenGL and with Intel i7.
* Newer, tighter safeprimes.
* Switch to default value of numberOfPhotonsAtMaxBrightness.
* Incorporate hybrid mode between GEANT4 and parametrization.

July 11, 2014 Claudio Kopper  (ckopper@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------

Release V04-00-03


* some code cleanup: removed the dataclasses header backports

  .. warning:: this version will not work with outdated dataclasses

* minor OpenCL cleanups to make some implementations happy
* added a benchmark script which can be used to check the GPU/CPU
  performance by propagating a couple of photons
* safeprimes file will now be taken from I3_DATA if it exists

February 03, 2013, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------

* more cleanups to move from I3MCPulse to I3MCPE
* fixed a bug where the MCTree chopping would ignore secondary losses
  leading to light from muon stochastic losses to be ignored
  when looking at data pre-processed with CMC

January 29, 2013 Claudio Kopper  (ckopper@icecube.wisc.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Release V03-00-00

* support for ice tilt and anisotropy
* tuned when running on AMD cards (Radeon 7970 on cobaltamdgpu)

June 14, 2012 Claudio Kopper  (ckopper@icecube.wisc.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------

Release V00-02-01

* replaces the OpenCL 1.1 version of the cl.hpp OpenCL C++ bindings
  with the 1.2 version. This currently breaks compatibility with
  some older OpenCL 1.0 implementations (notably Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard),
  but allows clsim to be compiled with newer versions of the AMD APP SDK.

May 31, 2012 Claudio Kopper  (ckopper@icecube.wisc.edu)
-------------------------------------------------------

Release V00-02-00

* fixes a bug where particles that fall below the Cherenkov threshold are immediately killed in Geant4
* allows "device fission" to be used to make the photon propagator only use a fixed number of cores
* can send statistics to a I3SummaryService
* includes a new propagation mode where absorption is ignored (for generating photon-tables)
* comes with a preliminary version of photon-tabulation code
* flashers now have the appropriate time delay distributions
* allows Standard Candle simulation
* I3PhotonSeriesMap is now based on ModuleKey instead of OMKey (if available)
* support mDOM simulations when compatible dataclasses are available
* the safeprimes auto-downloader should be compatible with more systems now
* oversized DOMs are compressed to ellipsoids to get better timing distributions


April 18, 2012 Claudio Kopper  (ckopper@icecube.wisc.edu)
---------------------------------------------------------

Release V00-01-05

This is a minor release that should improve compatibility with
older nVidia cards (such as GTX 295) that do not have as much GPU
memory as newer cards. The maximum amount of memroy will now
only be used on nVidia cards that have either "Tesla", "GTX 580"
or "GTX 680" in their names.

Performance for large I3MCTrees should be significantly
improved in this release.
